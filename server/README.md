# ðŸ§­ server

This is the backend API for Compass.

**Prerequisites for development**:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Node.js >= v18
  - You can check your version with `node -v`.
  - If it's out of date, [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a great tool to manage multiple Node versions and keep it up-to-date.

## Getting started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and modify as necessary
2. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the database
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run db:reset` to reset and migrate the database
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode
6. By default, the server will be running at `http://localhost:8080`

## Running tests

The database container does not need to be started to run tests, but Docker Desktop must be running in the background.

Run all tests with `npm run test`. An individual test file can be run with `npm run test <path/to/file>` (e.x. `npm run test src/routes/students.test.ts`).

To run tests in watch mode, use `npm run test:watch`. This will run tests whenever a file is changed, but will not take database schema changes into account.

## Database

### Creating migrations

Until Compass is deployed, the initial migration file at `src/db/migrations/1_initial-migrations.sql` should be edited. Once Compass is deployed, new migrations can be created in the same directory by adding `1` to the number of the last migration file.

### Running migrations

Run `npm run db:migrate` to migrate the database. However, until Compass is deployed, you'll more likely want to run `npm run db:reset` to reset the database since we'll be making changes to the initial migration file.
