   * This test verifies that all API endpoints in the application are properly protected by authentication.
   *
   * It works by:
   * 1. Creating a mock request and response object.
   * 2. Generating a context with no authentication.
   * 3. Creating a trpc caller with this unauthenticated context.
   * 4. Iterating through all procedures in the trpcRouter.
   * 5. Attempting to call each procedure without authentication.
   * 6. Expecting an UNAUTHORIZED error for each call (except for explicitly excluded endpoints).
   *
   * This ensures that no sensitive endpoints are accidentally left unprotected,
   * maintaining the security of the API.
